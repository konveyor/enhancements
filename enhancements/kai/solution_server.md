# Kai Solution Server

## Summary

The Kai Solution Server captures migration solutions from across an organization, making them easily
accessible to improve automated code migrations. By using past successes and failures, it helps Kai
provide better migration hints and identifies areas where automation can be enhanced.

## Motivation

Currently, Kai helps developers individually with migration issues. Leveraging organizational
knowledge from past migration attempts can significantly enhance migration outcomes and reduce
manual intervention. The Solution Server aims to achieve this by providing clear success metrics,
historical insights, and identifying migration tasks that consistently require manual resolution.

### Goals

- Provide clear visibility into the effectiveness of migration rules.
- Improve the success rates of automated migrations using historical data.
- Identify recurring migration challenges to guide improvements.

### Non-Goals

- Developing new migration rules or scenarios that do not already exist within collected data.
- Integration with external or third-party solution databases.

## Proposal

The Kai Solution Server will implement the following core functions:

### Data Collection

The Solution Server will collect detailed migration-related data from IDEs, including:
- Source code before migration
- Modified code after migration
- Metadata about migration tasks (languages, frameworks, rules triggered)
- Outcomes of migration attempts (accepted, rejected, modified)
- Specific user modifications when automated solutions are adjusted

### Storage and Organization

- Collected data will be structured to support easy retrieval, analysis, and reuse.
- Data organization will align closely with migration rules and associated metadata.

### Analysis and Insights

- Calculate and expose success rates for migration rules.
- Identify patterns in successful and unsuccessful migration solutions.
- Extract and summarize insights that can directly inform future automated migration attempts.

### Enhanced Context for Automation Tools

- Provide historical examples and success metrics directly to the IDE plugin.
- Enable any other MCP-compatible tools to leverage past successful solutions to improve current migrations.

### Issue Identification and Expert Review

- Automatically flag migration tasks or rules that consistently fail or require extensive manual intervention.
- Highlight flagged issues for expert review and potential process improvements.

## Security and Risks

- Collected data, including application source code and modifications, must be securely stored and
  transferred with robust encryption and access controls.
- Define clear security policies to ensure appropriate access to solution data.

## Initial Testing Focus

- Validate data collection, storage accuracy, and retrieval effectiveness.
- Confirm accuracy of computed success rates and insights.

## Potential Challenges

- Effectively managing large volumes of collected migration data.
- Maintaining high-quality and actionable insights from historical data.

## Infrastructure Needs

- Structured database optimized for storing and querying migration-related data.
- Kubernetes deployment infrastructure compatible with existing Konveyor Hub deployments.
