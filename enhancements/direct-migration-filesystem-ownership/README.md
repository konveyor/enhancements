# Filesystem ownership reconciliation with direct volume migrations

While working the [direct volume migration](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MIG-284)
feature, it became apparent that is can be complex to manage the owner and group permissions of volumes between
the source, replication pod (rsync pod), and target destination pods. This is
especially true when considering the many different provisioners that potentially
behave differently with regard to security contexts (some respect the fsGroup,
while some unusual ones do not).

## Observed issue

With the original implementation of DVM, the rsync transfer pod was run
as a priviliged pod, meaning it executed as root. By launching the pod with
these properties, it mutated the source volumes's filesystem permission bits
to **no longer match those of the original** (in this case, obviously it would
not be able to access root permissioned files). This caused the source workload
to crashloop with permission errors while trying to access its volume's data.

Additionally, upon closer investigation, it became clear that copying the
securityContext from the source Pod's may prevent the source workload from
crashlooping, but if the Pod continues to run as privileged, this is a significant
security hole. Any user with exec access to the Pod would have the ability to
exec into it and access the node's filesystem, therefore gaining access to
sensitive credentials that could be used for privilege escalation.

## BZ Root Cause Analysis

In order to root cause this bug the following test set up was used:

1. A dummy pod was setup to replace the rsync client pod. This pod just sleeps
2. On gp2 even with a dummy pod, the application broke. This strongly suggests that mounting gp2 volumes twice is the problem, nothing to do with rsync.
3. There is a SCC field called fsGroup. More info here https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/storage/persistent_storage/persistent-storage-nfs.html#storage-persistent-storage-nfs-group-ids_persistent-storage-nfs. It was observed that the application pod has fsGroup of 1000570000, whereas the rsync client pod(and the dummy pod) did not. The fsGroup is used to isolate block storages from one container to another and the host. It was immediately clear that we need the same fsGroup as the application pod in rsync pod and dummy pod.
4. The dummy pod was then started with the same scc fsgroup as the application pod.
5. The application did not break.

Observations:

When the application is broken (this was taken from the node where the volume is mounted.

```
sh-4.2# getfacl vol-0d96f2165bbe22a64/
# file: vol-0d96f2165bbe22a64/
# owner: root
# group: 1000570000
# flags: -s-
user::rwx
group::rwx
other::r-x
```

```
sh-4.2# cd vol-0d96f2165bbe22a64/
sh-4.2# getfacl userdata/
# file: userdata/
# owner: 1000570000
# group: 1000570000
# flags: -s-
user::rwx     ← note the permission is only to the user
group::---
other::---
```

The rsync client pod is running as root user and the application pod is running
as 1000570000 user. The application pod cannot see contents owned by the root user

When the application is not broken:

```
sh-4.2# getfacl vol-0d96f2165bbe22a64/
# file: vol-0d96f2165bbe22a64/
# owner: root
# group: 1000570000
# flags: -s-
user::rwx
group::rwx
other::r-x
```

```
sh-4.2# getfacl userdata/
# file: userdata/
# owner: 1000570000
# group: 1000570000
# flags: -s-
user::rwx                     ← Note both the user and the group has the permissions
group::rwx
other::---
```

The group, in this case, is the same as the application user, hence the application pod does not break.)

## Proposed solution

Before starting the rsync client pod, we check if the pvc’s are attached to
any pods in the namespace.

I'm going to use `securityContext` in the following as a shorthand for
`securityContext.{fsGroup,supplementalGroups,seLinuxOptions}`

* If any pvc is attached to one or more pods:
  * Attached to one pod, get its `securityContext` and use the same `securityContext` for the rsync
  client pods and explicitly set the node to match the current pod that the
  volume is attached to.
  * Attached to more than one pod, raise a warning because this could lead to
  indeterminate behavior. Pick any of the pods’s `securityContext` at random and use it
  for the rsync client pod while explicitly setting the node to match the picked pod’s.
  * If pvc’s are attached to pods and none of them have a `securityContext`.
  This will adopt the namespaces default security context.

* If not attached to any pod:
  * Run without explicit `securityContext`, adopting default `securityContext`.

### privileged vs. anyuid

Initially we ran the source transfer Pod as privileged, which provides a number
of extra "capabilities", inluding access to host devices. It became clear this
could be used to escalate privleges beyond what an admin over a namespace should
have. Instead, `anyuid` should provide the ability to run with `uid` 0, giving
us enough privileges to satisfy our requirement for having sufficient privileges
to exactly clone all filesystem permission attributes to the destination without
suffering privilege issues.

Notable differences between `anyuid` and `privileged` are:

1) The capabilities that are afforded to `privileged` that will mount the problematic
dev from the node is not present with `anyuid`.

2) `anyuid` is "constrained" by SELinux, while `privileged` is "unconstrained".
This adds the an additional layer of restriction to prevent unauthorized file access.

As an additional improvement beyond `anyuid`, we can define a custom SCC that
drops all capabilities and only whitelists the specific privileges we require.

## Edge cases

In the event that the transfer pod running as the anyuid is not sufficient,
We'd like to build an "escape hatch" into the operator
that allows admins to **explicitly opt in** to running the transfer pod as
privileged. Proper caution should be taken in this case by the admin to ensure
unauthorized access to the transfer pod is not possible while the transfer is underway.
