# Add a binaries download page to the hub UI

## Release Signoff Checklist

- [x] Enhancement is `implementable`
- [x] Design details are appropriately documented from clear requirements
- [ ] Test plan is defined
- [ ] User-facing documentation is created

## Summary

A new page is added to the Konveyor Hub UI. On the page, users can view and download all the user-facing Konveyor tooling binaries.

## Motivation

Users should have easy ways to download the appropriate tooling for the version of Konveyor they are using.
This page is inspired by a similar page in the OpenShift UI that allows users to download the `oc` binary.

### Goals

- Users can download the Konveyor binaries for their OS and architecture from the Hub UI

### Non-Goals

- Magically determining which binaries they should install. We should just provide a list.

## Proposal

### User Stories [optional]

#### Story 1

As a user, I want to use the CLI Konveyor tools. I go to the HUB UI, click the binary for my Operating System and architecture, and use it.

## Design Details

### Test Plan

When testing the CLI tools with our current tests, we should download them from the Hub.

## Implementation History

TBD

## Drawbacks

- Requires us to bake all the binaries into the hub image. Could inflate the size and add complexity to the build process.

## Alternatives

TBD
