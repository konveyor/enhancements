# Codify and Apply Transformations

## Release Signoff Checklist

- [ ] Enhancement is `implementable`
- [ ] Design details are appropriately documented from clear requirements
- [ ] Test plan is defined
- [ ] User-facing documentation is created

## Open Questions [optional]


## Summary

Transformations are needed when moving Kubernetes manifests between clusters,
between distributions or even to move particular objects to be reconciled by
new controllers. 
These transformations need to be sharable, testable, and idempotent.

## Motivation

The transformations are essential for users who want the choice of distribution, 
need to move applications between clusters, or want to move to a new deployment
 mechansim such as [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/).

### Goals

- Ability to run transformations on a set of Kubernetes manifests
- Ability to codify the transformations and run them
- Ability to run transformations such that they must be applied at one time
- When Applying transformations, the tool should warn about conflicting changes to a particular path

### Non-Goals

- Any mechanism to ship/package or otherwise distribute transformations
- Transformations and application of transformations run in a single command

## Proposal

### User Stories

#### Story 1

As a library user, I would like to create transformations that I define easily.

#### Story 2

As a library user, given a set of transformations, I would like to apply them 
to a YAML object and return a YAML object.

#### Story 3

As a library user, I would like to easily create the CLI commands 
that conforms to the transform CLI interface, by only having to provide the
code that provides my transformation. 

As a transformations runner author, I would like to verify that I can expect the
same set of CLI flags and sub command name to provide the transformation from
a plugin

## Design Details

### Implementation

#### Packages

##### transfrom

A library that will be responsible for helpers for creating and updating the
defined files for a transform directory.
This will work on file byte arrays to make all the implementation details of
the file, internal to the package.
We will add a versioning system for this file and internally to this package

##### transform/kubernetes

Create the reusable plugin for the Kubernetes changes that must be applied to
enable a transformation from one Kubernetes to another Kubernetes cluster.
The plugin/library should be focused only on changes to manifests that will most likely have
to run on all distributions/versions of Kubernetes.

##### apply

A package responsible for applying a transformation defined as a byte array,
to create a new byte array that a user can use.
The user is responsible for what to do with the new byte array that will be
valid YAML.


### Test Plan

We will use a set of test data files to verify that the transforms created
correctly and that the application of the transformations is correct.
An e2e test will be created to use the cmd package and exercise fully
the defined interface that we expect to be present.
